Generic about components and passing props
actual value is put where the return is final
so if I import a component, ie button, header- I put props where the component is 
created; but the value of the prop, where it is imported for returning

Events
#2- uppercase function names
-for easiness, put function to a component where it is imported?

The useEffect Hook
Plain and simple, useEffect lets you perform side effects in function components.

Qn 
Good at just rendering out information to display, 
Downside- to change something in context, all the components that use the context, when we update the code in our useContext, all
the components that use this context re-render.
